This thorough text begins with limited special education in such venues as South Africa, and Senegal. Section Two addresses emerging special education in Nigeria, Brazil, and several other locales. Segregated special education in Japan, Russia, and other countries makes up Section Three, and Section Four explores countries that are approaching integration, such as Poland and Australia. Integrated special education is described in Scandinavia, New Zealand, and other nations in the final section.More than 50 noted scholars have contributed to this important work, offering every involved student and practitioner an indispensable, detailed frame of reference in which to assess education programs worldwide for all special populations -- blind, deaf, physically and mentally disabled, and all others.",

        "description": "This volume considers the ways in which educational research is being shaped by policy across the globe. Policy effects on research are increasingly influential, as policies in and beyond education drive the formation of a knowledge-based economy by supporting increased international competitiveness through more effective, evidence-based interventions in schooling, education and training systems. What consequences does this increased steering have for research in education? How do transnational agencies make their influence felt on educational research? How do national systems and traditions of educational research - and relations with policy - respond to these new pressures? What effects does it have on the quality of research and on the freedom of researchers to pursue their own agendas? The 2006 volume of the World Yearbook of Education explores these issues, focusing on three key themes: globalising policy and research in education steering education research in national contexts global-local politics of education research. The 2006 volume has a truly global reach, incorporating transnational policy perspectives from the OECD and the European Commission, alongside national cases from across the world in contrasting contexts that include North and South America, Canada, France, Singapore, China, Russia and New Zealand. The range of contributions reflect how pervasive these developments are, how much is new in this situation and to what extent evidence-based policy pressures on research in education build on past relationships between education and policy. This book considers the impact of the steering processes on the work and identities of individual researchers and considers how research can be organised to play a more active role in the politics of the knowledge economy and learning society.",

        "description": "Public education is often viewed as dominated by an emphasis on test scores and narrowly defined parameters of performance and achievement. By contrast, John P. Miller's Whole Child Education fosters relationships between various forms of thinking, links body and mind, and recognizes the inner life of the child. Addressing issues of teaching, curriculum, the school, and teacher wellness, Miller presents three basic approaches (transmission, transaction, and transformation) that facilitate a connection with the whole student. Practical examples from teachers who have incorporated Miller's ideas into their own classrooms and description of Toronto's Whole Child School (founded in 2009) illustrate how the 'Whole Curriculum' can be implemented on both the small and large scale. Inspired by the powerful vision of Martin Luther King and his concept of the Beloved Community, Whole Child Education is a vehicle for building community through holistic education.",

The country now seems well set to provide universal and good quality basic education. Yet, behind this otherwise rosy picture lie serious concerns relating primarily to gender and equity. /-//-/This volume provides an insightful understanding of the ground realities of primary education programmes, particularly those run by the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP). Combining secondary research with field studies conducted in six states, the contributors explore gender and social equity issues in primary education. They conclude that there is a subtle but nevertheless discernible ‘hierarchy of access’ to education, which has resulted in new forms of segregation in primary schools.",

This, therefore, is the first book to address women’s leadership within science education. The book embraces relational ways of knowing as a foundation for leadership and takes courageous steps by exposing our innermost tensions, dilemmas, and feelings about leadership, making them available to others. The power/promise of feminine approaches to transform traditional leadership cultures is also addressed. The authors believe that anyone can lead, regardless of position, title, years of experience or age. They also believe that each of us has a responsibility to provide some leadership and direction for the shared endeavours of which we are part. The purpose of the book is to inspire and guide educators and academics in K-16 science education, as well as individuals in other professions, as their leadership skills develop. The leadership activities provided offer guidance and/or concrete ways to delve into issues of leadership.",

It is the dream of every parent to ensure his child acquires higher education. This desire has led to an immense expansion higher education in the United States over the twentieth century. It is explicit that higher education bears a wide range of benefits to individuals, as well as the government. Foremost, individuals with higher education benefit from what is referred to as positive selection. A utility maximization paradigm based on economic factors holds that attainment of higher education corresponds to high economic returns. The precepts of the positive selection hypothesis as described by Heckman, Urzua & Vytlacil (2006) hold that those who acquire higher education benefit most from it. As such, it is apparent that higher education has economic and social benefits. For instance, college graduates receive better remuneration than their counterparts with a high school diploma. It is also true that higher education attracts a high social esteem in the modern society. Despite these benefits, higher education has negative aspects too. Therefore, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive discussion of the negative aspects of higher education.",

With the background of the consequences of the Second World War on the view of an army of the German population and the bad acceptance of the Bundeswehr in the society, the view of a military education is a different one, compared to the U.S for example. Unlike in the U.S, where military education is partially integrated into the school system in Germany military education is only provided by the military itself or in small private settings. The aim of this term paper is to find out what is the meaning of military education in German society in functionalist perspective. “(...) Education must teach people self-discipline; education is essential if society is to remain orderly ”. These pedagogical findings of Èmile Durkheim studies haven’t lost their relevance in our present time when it comes to the question of the meaning and importance of education in our society. These aspects - self-discipline and order - are especially determine in the principles that represent soldiers in the military. This connection should give rise to drawing parallels between military education in a functionalist perspective and the understanding and implementation of it in German society. From the functionalist perspective of Durkheim the aim of education in a society is to produce “ideal adults” in order that to ensure the overriding goal, specifically the functioning and survival of society . Can the values and virtues that can be imparted by a military education and that constitute and should be represented by a German soldier lead the way to the aim of an \"ideal adult\" described by Durkheim?",
