The Business Process Model and Notation based on BPMNTM 2 training introduces participants to the essence of the language. BPMN or Business Process Model and Notation is the standard for modeling business processes. Currently under the care of The Object Management Group® (OMG®), BPMN has had a checkered history which we believe reflects the complexity it seeks to standardise. Process models are much older than the kind of models that UML tried to standardize. These UML models often have a much more intimate relationship with software development. We can trace process models back to Frederick Winslow Taylor who was one of the first to attempt to look at production processes in a scientific way. This happened in the 19th century, at a time when people had unwavering faith in the ability of science (and technology) to solve all problems. Before you can proceed to control, improve or even innovate the processes of your organization, it is important to provide insight into the processes. How do you ensure that the knowledge of individuals comes together and is transferable and accessible to the entire organization? As a modeling language, BPMN offers a standard for communicating about business processes.

But all too often, we fail to adapt, clinging to outdated business models that are no longer delivering the results we need. The brains behind The Business Model Navigator have discovered that just 55 business models are responsible for 90% of our most successful businesses.

As well as providing a practical framework for adapting and innovating your business model, this book also includes each of the 55 models in a quick-read format that covers: What it is Who invented it and who uses it now When and how to apply it The full text downloaded to your computer With eBooks you can: search for key concepts, words and phrases make highlights and notes as you study share your notes with friends eBooks are downloaded to your computer and accessible either offline through the Bookshelf (available as a free download), available online and also via the iPad and Android apps.

This process involves the identification of vulnerabilities on communication networks.

Presented in a highly accessible format, How to Write a Business Plan also includes a full glossary, case histories and a detailed section on the related issue of how a company can best use internal business plans.",

        "description": "Master's Thesis from the year 2015 in the subject Business economics - Miscellaneous, grade: 1, University of Vienna (Institut für Betriebswirtschaftslehre), course: E-Business, language: English, abstract: The era of information technologies (hereafter IT) has lead to a shift from exchanging goods to services and at the same time to a tremendous increase of companies operating in the field of electronic business. As continuous changes of the environment take place in this field, it is crucial for the companies to come up with new technologies and solutions on a regular basis (Oliveira et al. 2002). This complex condition leads to on-going development, adaptation and maintenance of eServices, which are seen as a central part of any electronic business activity due to their contribution to interactivity, connectivity, increase of customer satisfaction as well as mass customization (Sheth and Sharma 2007). Succeeding in these mentioned tasks guarantees long-term benefits for the companies, helps them to achieve their stated targets, as well as to retain a strong competitive advantage, which is of a great importance. However, eServices need to be managed properly in order to really be a benefit for the company. One of these fundamental management tasks includes the continuous business value assessment of eServices, which is not only suitable for the calculation of the business value, but is also able to indicate, whether the eService contributes to the achievement of the company’s key performance indicators and how well it performs. The assessment of eServices business value is conducted using appropriate methods and metrics, which lies the midpoint of this Master thesis examination.",
