        "description": "It is widely recognized that travel and tourism can have a high environmental impact and make a major contribution to climate change. It is therefore vital that ways to reduce these impacts are developed and implemented. 'Slow travel' provides such a concept, drawing on ideas from the 'slow food' movement with a concern for locality, ecology and quality of life. The aim of this book is to define slow travel and to discuss how some underlining values are likely to pervade new forms of sustainable development. It also aims to provide insights into the travel experience; these are explored in several chapters which bring new knowledge about sustainable transport tourism from across the world. In order to do this the book explores the concept of slow travel and sets out its core ingredients, comparing it with related frameworks such as low-carbon tourism and sustainable tourism development. The authors explain slow travel as holiday travel where air and car transport is rejected in favour of more environmentally benign forms of overland transport, which generally take much longer and become incorporated as part of the holiday experience. The book critically examines the key trends in tourism transport and recent climate change debates, setting out the main issues facing tourism planners. It reviews the potential for new consumption patterns, as well as current business models that facilitate hyper-mobility. This provides a cutting edge critique of the 'upstream' drivers to unsustainable tourism. Finally, the authors illustrate their approach through a series of case studies from around the world, featuring travel by train, bus, cycling and walking. Examples are drawn from Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Cases include the Eurostar train (as an alternative to air travel), walking in the Appalachian Trail (US), the Euro-Velo network of long-distance cycling routes, canoe tours on the Gudena River in Denmark, sea kayaking in British Columbia (Canada) and the Oz Bus Europe to Australia.",

        "description": "Despite the recent increase in scholarly activity regarding travel writing and the accompanying proliferation of publications relating to the form, its ethical dimensions have yet to be theorized with sufficient rigour. Drawing from the disciplines of anthropology, linguistics, literary studies and modern languages, the contributors in this volume apply themselves to a number of key theoretical questions pertaining to travel writing and ethics, ranging from travel-as-commoditization to encounters with minority languages under threat. Taken collectively, the essays assess key critical legacies from parallel disciplines to the debate so far, such as anthropological theory and postcolonial criticism. Also considered, and of equal significance, are the ethical implications of the formâ€™s parallel genres of writing, such as ethnography and journalism. As some of the contributors argue, innovations in these genres have important implications for the act of theorizing travel writing itself and the mode and spirit in which it continues to be conducted. In the light of such innovations, how might ethical theory maintain its critical edge?",

Travel time information is and will continue to be one key indicator of the quality of service of a road network and a highly valued knowledge for drivers. Moreover, travel times are key inputs for comprehensive traffic management systems. All the above-mentioned aspects are covered in this book. The first chapters expound on the different types of travel time information that traffic management centers work with, their estimation, their utility and their dissemination. They also remark those aspects in which this information should be improved, especially considering future cooperative driving environments.Next, the book introduces and validates two new methodologies designed to improve current travel time information systems, which additionally have a high degree of applicability: since they use data from widely disseminated sources, they could be immediately implemented by many administrations without the need for large investments. Finally, travel times are addressed in the context of dynamic traffic management systems. The evolution of these systems in parallel with technological and communication advancements is thoroughly discussed. Special attention is paid to data analytics and models, including data-driven approaches, aimed at understanding and predicting travel patterns in urban scenarios. Additionally, the role of dynamic origin-to-destination matrices in these schemes is analyzed in detail.",

That report acted as a stimulus to further research into the health of air crew and passengers, and led to a broader examination of such issues. The report also led to the setting up of the Aviation Health Working Group in 2001, and later the Aviation Health Unit, in 2003, within the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which acts as a focal point for aviation health in the UK. In this report the Committee sets out the current situation, and still finds issues that remain of concern, particularly the risk to air travellers of venous thromboembolism (VTE). A WHO study is to examine VTE risk for individuals with existing risk factors, and the Committee urges the Government to continue to support this project. The Committee also believes that further investigation into the effects of fumes on pilots and others should be continued. The Committee has set out a number of recommendations, including: that jet lag should be studied as a confounding effect of DVT; that the Government should explore ways to increase the research capacity in aviation health; that the CAA should implement the recommendations of its own research into aircraft seating standards, and increase the minimum seat pitch to at least 28.2 inches; the Government should also review the level of air passenger duty levied on \"premium economy\" seating; also that the Government and airlines advise passengers on the proven benefits of good hygiene in the reduction of disease transmission, and that as part of their contingency plans airlines that are flying from areas affected by a pandemic, should provide bacterial wipes to passengers; that the Government and the AHU work together with airlines and others in providing consistent air travel advice to passengers on the risks associated with self-medicating with the intention of preventing DVT.",

        "description": "The â€˜Travel Tales Collection, Airplane Stories,â€™ No. 9, April 2015, is part of Michael Breinâ€™s â€˜Collectionsâ€™ travel tales series and contains among the best travel stories from Michaelâ€™s huge collection of travel tales that he has gathered in interviews with nearly 1,750 world travelers and adventurers during his four decades of travel to more than 125 countries throughout the world. â€˜Travel Tales Collectionsâ€™ are groups of very interesting similar travel stories of a kind on a variety of very specific travel subjects, themes, or countries, such as close calls, great escapes, pickpocketing, scams, safety and security in travel, Paris, Morocco, Mexico, and so on. Eventually, several hundred â€˜Collectionsâ€™ on all sorts of specific travel subjects, themes, and countries will be available on all the major eReaders. An airline story is in the news today! And so it goes. Thereâ€™s hardly a day now that an airline incident of some sort or another is not in the news. Weâ€™re taking a lot closer look at air travel these days than ever before. Therefore, as regards the psychology of travel, we should take a much closer look at what actually happens on airplanes. And so, in The Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series, that's exactly what I do. Air-travel-life stories include the full range of the human air travel experience, from pre-boarding incidents to arrivals; from the cabin to the loo; from the public and private lives of airline personnel as well as passengersâ€”from the pilots to the stews to youâ€”from that which makes us laugh to that which makes us cry, as well as, unfortunately, to that which creates abject fear and terror in the skies. Air travel is now more in the public eye than ever before. Thus, it is no wonder now that regarding the experience of traveling in the skiesâ€”like any other aspect of travelâ€”we are not only more circumspect than ever beforeâ€”we are, on closer view, now much more aware of how air travel is now seen to elicit the full range of the human experience. And in this one particular unique microcosmic window of scrutiny we see that air-travel is but one unique travel environment in a cornucopia of many others, and one that is neither unimportant, insignificant, indistinct, nor independent with respect to the overall experience of travel. Love it, hate it, or simply endure it, the lure of traveling in the skies, whether as just a means to a place or as an end in and of itself, the activity of flying, per seâ€”airplane travel stories not only endure, they are on the increase. Whether you've survived a crash, been bombed by terrorists, been part and parcel of other scares and frights, been harassed upon departure or on arrival, or even laughed yourself stupid on a flight, your tales are memorable, and it is my personal mission that some of them are repeated here! Introduction to Travel Tales of Airplanes: Terror in the Skies! Part 1 Travel Tales of Airplanes: Terror in the Skies! is divided into two parts simply because there is so much material. Part 1 appears here in the current Travel Tales Collection issue No. 9 Apr 2015 and serves as a general introduction to this subject matter. Part 2 The unabridged, expanded forthcoming ebook Travel Tales of Airplanes: Terror in the Skies, part of The Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series, is a larger volume and includes both Parts 1 and 2. The travel stories in Part 1 consist mainly of the personal air travel tales of Michael Brein (me), the author, plus those of a few other contributors. The travel stories in Part 2 are, largely, the air travel stories of world travelers and adventurers whom Iâ€™ve encountered and interviewed all throughout my travels over the last four decades to 125 countries. Mostly, your own air travel will typically be exciting, interesting, and without incident, but odd things can and do happen to you at almost any turn along the way in your travels, and air travel is no exception. Unfortunately, the restricted, constricted, and microcosmic environment of the airplane lends itself sometimes to a variety of episodes illustrating the vagaries of the human temperament and behavior that rear their ugliness on airplanes from time to time, whereby air passengers and crew sometimes act and behave in ways that are often atypical and different from how we normally would behave at home. I hope only peaceful and laughable events happen to you in your air travels. I sincerely hope that the negative travel tales of airplanes do not happen to you in your own travels. If something interesting happens to you in your air travels, you deserve to also be in these pages! Got an interesting travel tale for The Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series? Please contact Michael Brein at michaelbrein@gmail.com. Note: Some stories may be repeated in other eBooks in the series depending on the countries and subjects covered.",

The report explores the types and purposes of models being used, integration of state and urban models, data requirements, computer needs, resources (including time, funding, training, and staff), limitations, and overall benefits. The report includes five case studies, two that focus on passenger components, two on freight components, and one on both passenger and freight.",
