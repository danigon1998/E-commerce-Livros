        "description": "Containing 609 encyclopedic articles written by more than 200 prominent scholars, The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science presents an unparalleled history of the field invaluable to anyone with an interest in the technology, ideas, discoveries, and learned institutions that have shaped our world over the past five centuries. Focusing on the period from the Renaissance to the early twenty-first century, the articles cover all disciplines (Biology, Alchemy, Behaviorism), historical periods (the Scientific Revolution, World War II, the Cold War), concepts (Hypothesis, Space and Time, Ether), and methodologies and philosophies (Observation and Experiment, Darwinism). Coverage is international, tracing the spread of science from its traditional centers and explaining how the prevailing knowledge of non-Western societies has modified or contributed to the dominant global science as it is currently understood. Revealing the interplay between science and the wider culture, the Companion includes entries on topics such as minority groups, art, religion, and science's practical applications. One hundred biographies of the most iconic historic figures, chosen for their contributions to science and the interest of their lives, are also included. Above all The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science is a companion to world history: modern in coverage, generous in breadth, and cosmopolitan in scope. The volume's utility is enhanced by a thematic outline of the entire contents, a thorough system of cross-referencing, and a detailed index that enables the reader to follow a specific line of inquiry along various threads from multiple starting points. Each essay has numerous suggestions for further reading, all of which favor literature that is accessible to the general reader, and a bibliographical essay provides a general overview of the scholarship in the field. Lastly, as a contribution to the visual appeal of the Companion, over 100 black-and-white illustrations and an eight-page color section capture the eye and spark the imagination.",

Placed in the context of the occult, philosophy of science issues become immediately understandable and forcefully compelling. Divergent views on astrology, parapsychology, and quantum mechanics mysticism emphasize topics standard to the philosophy of science. Such issues as confirmation and selection for testing, causality and time, explanation and the nature of scientific laws, the status of theoretical entities, the problem of demarcation, theory and observation, and science and values are discussed. Significantly revised, this second edition presents an entirely new section of quantum mechanics and mysticism including instructions from N. David Mermin for constructing a device which dramatically illustrates the genuinely puzzling phenomena of quantum mechanics. A more complete and current review of research on astrology has been included in this new edition, and the section on the problem of demarcation has been broadened.",

        "description": "Escrito pelos maiores especialistas do mundo em pensamento estratégico e autores dos best-sellers Rápido e devagar e Nudge, este livro vai mudar sua maneira de pensar e tomar decisões. Imagine que dois médicos na mesma cidade façam diagnósticos distintos a pacientes com o mesmo problema ou que dois juízes no mesmo tribunal deem sentenças diferentes a pessoas que cometeram o mesmo crime. Agora, suponha que este mesmo médico e este mesmo juiz tomem decisões diversas dependendo se é manhã ou tarde, segunda-feira ou quarta-feira, antes ou depois do almoço. Estes são exemplos de ruído: variabilidade em julgamentos que deveriam ser idênticos. Neste livro, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony e Cass R. Sunstein mostram que o ruído tem efeitos prejudiciais em muitos campos, incluindo medicina, direito, saúde pública, previsão econômica, ciência forense, proteção à criança, avaliações de desempenho e seleção de pessoal. No entanto, indivíduos e organizações frequentemente ignoram seu impacto, a um grande custo. Baseado em extensa pesquisa e repleto de ideias originais, este livro explica como e por que os seres humanos são tão suscetíveis ao ruído e aos vieses ao fazer escolhas. Revela também que, com algumas soluções simples, podemos reduzir ambos e, assim, tomar decisões muito melhores. \"Prepare-se para algumas das maiores mentes do mundo ajudarem você a avaliar pessoas, tomar decisões e resolver problemas.\" — Adam Grant \"A maior fonte de políticas ineficazes muitas vezes não são vieses, corrupção ou má vontade, mas três 'is': intuição, ignorância e inércia. Este livro demonstra de forma magistral por que eles são tão presentes e o que podemos fazer para combatê-los. Uma leitura essencial e esclarecedora.\" — Esther Duflo \"Um tour de force de erudição e texto acessível.\" — The New York Times \"Bem-pesquisado, convincente e prático. Todos os acadêmicos, formuladores de políticas públicas e líderes deveriam ler este livro. Pessoas com o poder e a persistência necessários para aplicar as ideias deste livro tomarão decisões mais humanas e justas, salvarão vidas e evitarão que tempo, dinheiro e talento sejam desperdiçados.\" — The Washington Post",

        "description": "In this collection of 15 essays, educators describe successful programs they've developed to fulfill the US National Science Education Standards' vision for the reform of teaching assessment, professional development, and content at the high school level. All the visions correspond with the Less Emphasis and More Emphasis conditions that conclude each section of the Standards, characterizing what most teachers and programs should do less of as well as describing the changes needed if real reform is to occur. Essay titles reveal the range of programs, and creativity, this book encompasses. Among the titles are: \"Technology and Cooperative Learning: The IIT Model for Teaching Authentic Chemistry Curriculum,\" \"Modeling: Changes in Traditional Physics Instruction,\" \"Guided by the Standards: Inquiry and Assessment in Two Rural and Urban Schools,\" and even \"Sing and Dance Your Way to Science Success.\" The book ends with a summary chapter by editor Robert Yager on successes and continuing challenges in meeting the Standards' visions for improving high school science. As Yager notes, \"The exemplary programs described in this monograph give inspiration while also providing evidence that the new directions are feasible and worth the energy and effort needed for others to implement changes.",
