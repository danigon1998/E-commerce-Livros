        "description": "This book addresses a topic that has received surprisingly little attention to date--the health and social needs of young adults with physical disabilities. Following an extensive review of the contemporary literature on the subject, the authors report an in-depth study on a large sample of physically disabled 18- to 25-year olds living in two survey areas, one urban and one semirural. The study, which included pediatric examinations and interviews by a social psychologist, found that a large proportion of subjects face social and medical problems, for instance: They have serious health needs that are not being met by the statutory services; they left school with less than adequate skills to enable them to lead an independent adult life; they are without a daytime occupation or attend day centers that are described as \"unstimulating\" places; they do not receive all the financial benefits to which they are entitled; they are isolated from their peers and lack the social skills to interact with others in a positive and successful way. Parents and guardians were also found to receive little physical or emotional support. These findings underline the need for a better system of providing and coordinating services for this client group, and the authors call for the formation, within each local health authority area, of an \"Adult Disability Service\" that would have a clinical and planning role in terms of health care and that would act as a linchpin in the coordination of health, educational, social, and voluntary services. Although this work relates specifically to service provision in the United Kingdom, it is felt that the conclusions and recommendations are also broadly applicable to the situation in other countries.",

        "description": "The American health care industry has undergone such dizzying transformations since the 1960s that many patients have lost confidence in a system they find too impersonal and ineffectual. Is their distrust justified and can confidence be restored? David Dranove, a leading health care economist, tackles these and other key questions in the first major economic and historical investigation of the field. Focusing on the doctor-patient relationship, he begins with the era of the independently practicing physician--epitomized by Marcus Welby, the beloved father figure/doctor in the 1960s television show of the same name--who disappeared with the growth of managed care. Dranove guides consumers in understanding the rapid developments of the health care industry and offers timely policy recommendations for reforming managed care as well as advice for patients making health care decisions. The book covers everything from start-up troubles with the first managed care organizations to attempts at government regulation to the mergers and quality control issues facing MCOs today. It also reflects on how difficult it is for patients to shop for medical care. Up until the 1970s, patients looked to autonomous physicians for recommendations on procedures and hospitals--a process that relied more on the patient's trust of the physician than on facts, and resulted in skyrocketing medical costs. Newly emerging MCOs have tried to solve the shopping problem by tracking the performance of care providers while obtaining discounts for their clients. Many observers accuse MCOs of caring more about cost than quality, and argue for government regulation. Dranove, however, believes that market forces can eventually achieve quality care and cost control. But first, MCOs must improve their ways of measuring provider performance, medical records must be made more complete and accessible (a task that need not compromise patient confidentiality), and patients must be willing to seek and act on information about the best care available. Dranove argues that patients can regain confidence in the medical system, and even come to trust MCOs, but they will need to rely on both their individual doctors and their own consumer awareness.",

It addressed a topic of concern to nearly every country, developing and industrial, that is, how to deal with the implications of financing medical care and income security for rapidly aging populations. The issues identified and the solutions proposed can provide insight and guidance for policymakers, researchers, and others interested in addressing these challenges now. Of special interest are the contributors' analyses of Singapore's unique, integrated approach to managing social risk, which is based on mandatory individual savings accounts.",

I observed and interviewed both traditional healers and western trained health professionals in Western Samoa. Now, based on my experiences both in New Zealand and in Western Samoa, I present some of my insights -- gained from observation, interview, group discussions and reflection -- as they relate to the New Zealand scene ... The book should be read as an introduction to cross-cultureal communication and health as well as to Samoan and to other non-western health practices. Enough information is provided so that western health professionals can have a sensible conversation with their Samoan patients, and vice versa. Some health professionals will, I hope, stop to reflect on the existence of cultural differences in talking health and in doing sickness. Where a western health professional reads this book and reflects on the nature of medical practice and the usage/provision of health care and begins to talk about western ways of doing sickness as only one possible way, a breakthrough will have occurred. This would amount to the recognition that what it means to be sick is culturally defined, that medical treatment and health services are cultural practices and culturally specific forms ...\" -- Introduction.",
